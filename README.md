# ZMK Keyboard for Cornix supporting various dongles.

This firmware has been tested with Cornix using ZMK and provides full split-role configuration, battery power management, and Bluetooth central/peripheral setup per ZMK split guidelines.

### about RGB

Cornix shield has 2 RGB LEDs on each side, controled by PWM in the stock firmware.

The replacement solution is adapting the RGB indicator module to light up these RGBs, to achieve the same effect as the stock firmware, which uses the RGB LEDs to indicate battery status and connection status. 

But it is not supported yet in this repository.  PR is welcome!

## Supported Hardware: Cornix Split Keyboard

Cornix Split Tented Lowâ€‘Profile Ergo Keyboard (Jezail Funder)

Cornix is a Corneâ€‘inspired split ergonomic keyboard featuring a compact 3Ã—6 columnâ€‘staggered layout with six thumbâ€‘cluster keys (three per half). It offers adjustable tenting angles at 10Â°, 18Â°, and 25Â°, allowing users to reduce wrist strain and find a custom ergonomic alignment

- **Split, columnâ€‘staggered layout** (3Ã—6 + thumb cluster layout).
- **Adjustable tenting support** at 10Â°,â€¯18Â°,â€¯25Â° (hardwareâ€‘based, no firmware hacks).
- **Kailh Choc V2 hotâ€‘swap sockets** and support for LAK or LCK lowâ€‘profile keycaps.
- **Dualâ€‘mode connectivity**: Wired USBâ€‘C or Bluetooth wireless (left half as master).
- **Firmware**: Fully VIALâ€‘supported for keymaps and layer customization, stock firmware is RMK.
- Premium **CNCâ€‘machined aluminum chassis**, custom damping foam, and portable storage pouch.

## ðŸ”° Easy Method: Clone This Repository and Build with GitHub Actions

If youâ€™re new to ZMK and donâ€™t want to deal with `west.yml` or module management, you can simply use this repository directly to customize your firmware.

### Steps

1. **Fork or Clone This Repository**
   - Click **Fork** in the top right to copy this repo to your GitHub account, or
   - Run `git clone` locally.

   > Forking is recommended, because GitHub Actions will automatically build your firmware.

2. **Edit Your Keymap**
   - Locate the keymap file in `config/cornix.keymap` (or whichever `.keymap` file you want to customize).
   - You can edit it directly or use the [ZMK Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/):
     - Open the editor and load your `.keymap` file.
     - Make changes with the visual editor.
     - Download the updated file and replace it in your repository.
     - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.

3. **Build with GitHub Actions**
   - After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically run the build.
   - Once the workflow finishes, go to **Actions â†’ your latest run â†’ Artifacts** and download the firmware (`.uf2`) files.

4. **Flash Your Keyboard**
   - Put your board into UF2 bootloader mode (usually by double-tapping the reset button).
   - Drag and drop the `.uf2` file onto the mounted drive.

### Who Is This For?

- Beginners to ZMK  
- Users who only want to customize keymaps  
- Anyone who doesnâ€™t need to modify drivers or hardware definitions

## How to build Cornix Zmk firmware from scratch

This section will guide you through building the Cornix ZMK firmware from scratch using the official ZMK firmware development process.


### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- A GitHub account
 Git installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub
- Your Cornix keyboard PCBs ready

### Step 1: Initialize ZMK Config Repository

1. **Create a new repository** using the official ZMK config template:
   - Visit: https://github.com/zmkfirmware/unified-zmk-config-template
   - Click "Use this template" â†’ "Create a new repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., `cornix-zmk-config`)
   - Choose "Public" or "Private" as preferred
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Clone your new repository locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```

3. **Initialize ZMK development environment**:
   ```bash
   west init -l config/
   west update
   west zephyr-export
   ```

> **Important**: You should thoroughly read the ZMK documentation before proceeding, as ZMK firmware development has a learning curve.

> - ZMK Configuration: https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup

### Step 2: Add Cornix Shield to Your Project

After initializing your zmk-config repository, follow the steps in the next section to integrate the Cornix shield.

## How to Add Cornix Shield to Existing ZMK Project

For users with existing zmk-config, add this repository dependency via west.yml and pull the latest version via west update:

### 1. Modify west.yml

Edit the `config/west.yml` file, add to the `manifest/remotes` section:

```yaml
remotes:
  - name: zmkfirmware
    url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
  - name: cornix-shield
    url-base: https://github.com/hitsmaxft
  - name: urob
    url-base: https://github.com/urob
```

Add to the `manifest/projects` section:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: zmk
    remote: zmkfirmware
    revision: main
    import: app/west.yml
  - name: zmk-keyboard-cornix
    remote: cornix-shield
    revision: main
  - name: zmk-helpers
    remote: urob
    revision: main
```

### 2. Update Dependencies

```bash
west update
```

### 3. Configure Build

Edit the `build.yaml` file, add:

> [!NOTE]
> 1. If you are using (default) cornix without dongle, choose "cornix_left", "cornix_right" and "reset".
> 2. If you are using cornix with dongle, choose "cornix_dongle". "cornix_left_for_dongle", "cornix_right" and "reset".
> 3. Add "cornix_indicator" shield to enable RGB led light. It consumes much more power, use at your own risk.
